This repo is created to be used for Jenkins Pipeline (Checkout, Build , Test, Deploy ).

# Checkout is main point and never forgot about it.
# After Checkout, go for Build part then Test and Deploy.
# Checkout  -> Pull out project from Github
# Build  -> Compile the project.
# Test  -> Test the project.
# Deliver / Deploy   ->  Either deliver the projectc to client and if required deploy for him after confirmation

In checkout, we pull the project from git , but in build as well we need to use git repo for extract and compile = build the code
